It served me well in its time here. I really loved the design - it looked gorgeous. But I never really liked how much had to be configured in the front matter in order to get certain things working. Anyway, I’m ready for a change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/minima&quot;&gt;Minima&lt;/a&gt; theme as a bit of a stopgap while I figured out what I wanted to do next. I waffled back and forth trying to decide whether I wanted to use an existing theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ultimately ended up deciding to not use a theme. I found a lot of the themes a bit too restrictive. If I wanted to do something as simple as adding customer items to the page &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or add some different items to the page &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;footer&lt;/code&gt;, I had to override these entire sections. What’s the point in using a theme if I would have to override large sections of the theme to add some pieces of information?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By not using a theme, I was able to make the site do whatever I wanted. I’m pretty happy with how it turned out. I’ll be making some tweaks here and there over the coming days/weeks/months of course. Nothing is ever static in web development.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Christopher Tobin</name></author><summary type="html">I had been rolling with the Minimal Mistakes theme for quite a while on this website.

  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;will-the-real-1-please-stand-up&quot;&gt;Will The Real #1 Please Stand Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious “issue” with this ranking is right at the very top. Ohio State was ranked #3 in the week 11 AP poll, but leapt both LSU and Alabama to #1 in the 1st CFP poll of 2019. This isn’t too crazy though:  the 3 teams were separated by a mere 12 points in the week 11 AP poll - a virtual tie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ohio State has dominated most of the teams on their schedule so far, and currently has 2 top 25 wins against #13 Wisconsin and #20 Cincinnati.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LSU hasn’t dominated the teams on their schedule like Ohio State, but they have arguably played a more difficult schedule. They currently have 2 top 25 wins against #10 Florida and #11 Auburn. They certainly have the most impressive non-conference win over Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alabama has won impressively for the most part this year, but they don’t have any top 25 wins so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-clemson&quot;&gt;About Clemson&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing drawing ire is the placing of Clemson at #5. An undefeated reigning National Champion is ranked outside of the top 4. How is this possible??? Clemson hasn’t really played anyone this year - they have no wins over a team currently ranked in the top 25. They have been winning impressively for the most part, but the strength (or lack thereof) of the ACC is holding them back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Penn State on the other hand currently has 2 top 25 wins against #14 Michigan and #18 Iowa. These wins are better than Ohio State’s ranked wins, but they haven’t looked nearly as dominating in their wins as Ohio State. Do they deserve to be ranked over Clemson? At this point in the season I don’t believe it is that unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately these rankings don’t really matter much anyway. Mid season rankings exist just to give people things to argue about. The teams in the top 4 of this poll will likely not all make the playoff. LSU and Alabama play each other this week, and Ohio State and Penn State play each other in a couple of weeks. Someone has to lose those games. Chaos would have to ensue in order for all 4 of these teams to make the playoff. Baylor could certainly make things interesting if they win out, and Oregon and Utah are also not going quietly into the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An undefeated Power 5 conference champion, who also happens to be reigning National Champions, would most certainly make the final top 4. Clemson has nothing to worry about as long as they win out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Christopher Tobin</name></author><summary type="html">The first rankings for the 2019 College Football Playoff are finally here!

This is a great way to get our feet wet by creating a program to solve a mathematical problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;multiples-of-3-and-5&quot;&gt;Multiples of 3 and 5&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-being-asked&quot;&gt;What is being asked&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to properly answer this problem (or any problem really), we must first understand what is being asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this problem, we are being asked to find the sum of all of the numbers that are multiples of either 3 &lt;strong&gt;OR&lt;/strong&gt; 5. That’s a pretty straightforward ask. The next part can be a bit less clear though, there is some ambiguity with the phrase &lt;strong&gt;below 1000&lt;/strong&gt;. With these types of phrases it is sometimes difficult to establish whether the number 1000 should be included. There are two things that give us some insight into whether to include 1000 in the list of potential numbers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The example uses the same wording when establishing the boundaries for the numbers - it asks for multiples &lt;strong&gt;below&lt;/strong&gt; 10. The answer to the example clearly does not include the number 10 because 5 is a multiple of 10.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The wording &lt;strong&gt;below&lt;/strong&gt; 1000 indicates that the numbers 1 through 999 should be considered. Because the number 1000 is not below 1000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;approach&quot;&gt;Approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we know what is being asked, our next objective is to determine all of the numbers up to, but not including, 1000 that are divisible by either 3 or 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a number to be divisible by another number, there must be no remainder left after the division is completed. For example, if we divide the number 3 by the number 2, the remainder will be 1. In this example, 3 is not divisible by 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we really wanted to we could solve this problem without writing any code. But what fun is that??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mod&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; operator would be very useful here, as that will tell us whether one number can be divided evenly into another number.&lt;/p&gt;

Overall, I’d have to say my experience has been pretty positive. It has in general been very easy to use. While Jekyll certainly has a learning curve (as all things do), it is definitely manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, my experience when adding a custom domain was not as simple as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; made it out to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When creating a personal site, GitHub suggests creating a repository named &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;.github.io&lt;/code&gt;. This will allow GitHub to auto-magically configure this repository for GitHub pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created this site in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sevenzerothree.github.io&lt;/code&gt; repository, making this a User Page as far as GitHub pages is concerned. This meant it would be hosted at &lt;a href=&quot;https://sevenzerothree.github.io&quot;&gt;https://sevenzerothree.github.io&lt;/a&gt; by default. I eventually grew tired of this, so I decided to add a custom domain to this site. I’ve owned &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;thesevenzerothree.com&lt;/code&gt; for several years now but I wasn’t really doing anything with it. This was the perfect opportunity to make it do something useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After adding my custom domain in the repository settings and fiddling with DNS settings, my personal site was loading perfectly on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thesevenzerothree.com&quot;&gt;https://www.thesevenzerothree.com&lt;/a&gt;. All was good right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrong. Very wrong. Adding this custom domain had an unintended side effect:  all of my project pages stopped being hosted on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sevenzerothree.github.io/{project}&lt;/code&gt; and instead were being hosted on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;thesevenzerothree.com/{project}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This drove me insane for days. Why was this happening? Did I misconfigure DNS somehow? Did I miss an option to redirect everything to my custom domain? Was this some bug in the GitHub Pages feature?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all good developers do, I took to Google to see if someone smarter than me had already encountered this. I came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/547&quot;&gt;this issue&lt;/a&gt; that added some insight to my problem. As it so happens, this is 100% intentional behavior as far as GitHub Pages is concerned. If you create a User Pages site and use a custom domain, this will affect all of the URLs for any Project Pages sites as well. All of the Project Pages sites will now be hosted on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;example.com/{project}&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;.github.io/{project}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is believe it or not &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/custom-domain-redirects-for-github-pages-sites/&quot;&gt;subtly mentioned in the documentation&lt;/a&gt;. In the table on that page, it does say that any Project Pages sites will be redirected to the custom domain used on the User Pages site if one exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this was designed behavior, I still didn’t like it. I wanted to have a custom domain for my personal site, but I didn’t want my project pages hosted on my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;thesevenzerothree.com&lt;/code&gt; domain. I also didn’t want to buy a different domain for my projects. That seemed totally unnecessary. I wanted my project pages hosted at &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sevenzerothree.github.io/{project}&lt;/code&gt;. There had to be a way to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-solution&quot;&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first solution I explored was to create a new Organization specifically for my personal site. The only repository in this Organization would be the one for my personal site. I would hook up my custom domain at this new repository so it would only affect repositories in this new organization. It wouldn’t affect my Personal repositories at all. I could even transfer the repository from my User account to this new Organization account and I wouldn’t lose any history. Sounds pretty straightforward right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it would have worked, it presented some compromises that I wasn’t comfortable with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating an Organization simply to host a personal website seemed a bit overkill&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I didn’t like the idea of having my personal site repository separate from my project repositories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I was making this much more difficult then it needed to be. I was working under the assumption that I had to host this site out of my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sevenzerothree.github.io&lt;/code&gt; repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have to do this at all. Project Pages support custom domains just like User Pages do. So the easiest solution was to just rename my repository from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sevenzerothree.github.io&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;thesevenzerothree.com&lt;/code&gt;. This converted my repository from a User Page to a Project Page, which means that any custom domain that I add will only affect that Project Page and nothing else. I had to re-add my custom domain on the repository settings but that’s no big deal. I didn’t even have to change any DNS settings!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I made this problem much more of an issue than it needed to be, I’m glad this is fixed. Now my personal site is hosted in my User account just like I wanted it to, and all of my Project Pages are hosted on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sevenzerothree.github.io&lt;/code&gt;. I consider that a victory.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Christopher Tobin</name></author><summary type="html">Adding a custom domain to a User Page hosted with GitHub pages doesn't just affect that page.
