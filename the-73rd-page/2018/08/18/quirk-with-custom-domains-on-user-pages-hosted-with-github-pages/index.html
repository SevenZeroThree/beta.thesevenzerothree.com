                    <p><a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> is a pretty neat feature of GitHub (if you haven’t been able to tell yet I use it to host this website). Overall, I’d have to say my experience has been pretty positive. It has in general been very easy to use. While Jekyll certainly has a learning curve (as all things do), it is definitely manageable.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my experience when adding a custom domain was not as simple as the <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site">docs</a> made it out to be.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>When creating a personal site, GitHub suggests creating a repository named <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;username&gt;.github.io</code>. This will allow GitHub to auto-magically configure this repository for GitHub pages.</p>

<p>I created this site in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">sevenzerothree.github.io</code> repository, making this a User Page as far as GitHub pages is concerned. This meant it would be hosted at <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://sevenzerothree.github.io</code> by default. I eventually grew tired of this, so I decided to add a custom domain to this site. I’ve owned <code class="highlighter-rouge">thesevenzerothree.com</code> for several years now but I wasn’t really doing anything with it. This was the perfect opportunity to make it do something useful.</p>

<p>After adding my custom domain in the repository settings and fiddling with DNS settings, my personal site was loading perfectly on <a href="https://www.thesevenzerothree.com">https://www.thesevenzerothree.com</a>. All was good right?</p>

<p>Wrong. Very wrong. Adding this custom domain had an unintended side effect:  all of my project pages stopped being hosted on <code class="highlighter-rouge">sevenzerothree.github.io/{project}</code> and instead were being hosted on <code class="highlighter-rouge">thesevenzerothree.com/{project}</code>.</p>

<p>This drove me insane for days. Why was this happening? Did I misconfigure DNS somehow? Did I miss an option to redirect everything to my custom domain? Was this some bug in the GitHub Pages feature?</p>

<p>Like all good developers do, I took to Google to see if someone smarter than me had already encountered this. I came across <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/547">this issue</a> that added some insight to my problem. As it so happens, this is 100% intentional behavior as far as GitHub Pages is concerned. If you create a User Pages site and use a custom domain, this will affect all of the URLs for any Project Pages sites as well. All of the Project Pages sites will now be hosted on <code class="highlighter-rouge">example.com/{project}</code> instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;username&gt;.github.io/{project}</code>.</p>

<p>This is believe it or not <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages#supported-custom-domains">subtly mentioned in the documentation</a>. In the table on that page, it does say that any Project Pages sites will be redirected to the custom domain used on the User Pages site if one exists.</p>

<p>Although this was designed behavior, I still didn’t like it. I wanted to have a custom domain for my personal site, but I didn’t want my project pages hosted on my <code class="highlighter-rouge">thesevenzerothree.com</code> domain. I also didn’t want to buy a different domain for my projects. That seemed totally unnecessary. I wanted my project pages hosted at <code class="highlighter-rouge">sevenzerothree.github.io/{project}</code>. There had to be a way to do this.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>

<p>The first solution I explored was to create a new Organization specifically for my personal site. The only repository in this Organization would be the one for my personal site. I would hook up my custom domain at this new repository so it would only affect repositories in this new organization. It wouldn’t affect my Personal repositories at all. I could even transfer the repository from my User account to this new Organization account and I wouldn’t lose any history. Sounds pretty straightforward right?</p>

<p>While it would have worked, it presented some compromises that I wasn’t comfortable with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Creating an Organization simply to host a personal website seemed a bit overkill</li>
  <li>I didn’t like the idea of having my personal site repository separate from my project repositories</li>
</ul>

<p>In the end, I was making this much more difficult then it needed to be. I was working under the assumption that I had to host this site out of my <code class="highlighter-rouge">sevenzerothree.github.io</code> repository.</p>

<p>I didn’t have to do this at all. Project Pages support custom domains just like User Pages do. So the easiest solution was to just rename my repository from <code class="highlighter-rouge">sevenzerothree.github.io</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">thesevenzerothree.com</code>. This converted my repository from a User Page to a Project Page, which means that any custom domain that I add will only affect that Project Page and nothing else. I had to re-add my custom domain on the repository settings but that’s no big deal. I didn’t even have to change any DNS settings!</p>

<p>Even though I made this problem much more of an issue than it needed to be, I’m glad this is fixed. Now my personal site is hosted in my User account just like I wanted it to, and all of my Project Pages are hosted on <code class="highlighter-rouge">sevenzerothree.github.io</code>. I consider that a victory.</p>
